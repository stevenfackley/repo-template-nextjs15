.SYNOPSIS
  PostToolUse — runs prettier + eslint --fix on edited JS/TS/CSS/MD/JSON files.
  Runs the PROJECT'S OWN copies only.

.DESCRIPTION
  `npx --no-install` is NOT "local only". It skips the install prompt but still
  resolves a GLOBAL binary from PATH, so in a repo that ships neither tool the
  machine's own prettier reformatted every edited file to its own defaults --
  80 columns into a codebase written at 100, which turned a three-line edit
  into a whole-file diff and buried the real change (lodge-donation-tracker
  #18). A globally installed eslint of a different major is the same trap.

  So each tool is located before it is run, and a repo that does not ship one
  is left alone -- which is what this hook always claimed to do.
